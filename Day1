-- To write a program that prints the number of characters in a user's name
Name = input("What is your name?")
print(len(Name))

-- To write a program that switches the values stored in the variables a and b
a = input("a: ")

-- Create a simple band name generator project
-- 1. Create a greeting for your program.
-- 2. Ask the user for the city that they grew up in.
-- 3. Ask the user for the name of a pet.
-- 4. Combine the name of their city and pet and show them their band name.
-- 5. Make sure the input cursor shows on a new line, see the example at:

print("Welcome to the band name generator.")

city = input("Which city did you grow up in?\n")

pet = input("What is the name of your pet?\n")

print("Your band name could be " + city + " " + pet)
